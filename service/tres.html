experiment and exploration. We, at The Roots India, believe that the children are the future of
the nation and they must learn beyond the four wall structure.
Our modules aim at experiential learning and using alternative education means to give the
children the opportunity to experiment with their ideas, explore their surroundings, experience
new situations and express their viewpoints. We work towards the overall development of a
child and instill an evolving thought process to make them liberal citizens of this developing
Nation.
Our modules are designed for a varied range of age groups and deal with the issues belonging to
that particular group only. Issues like Bullying, Sex Education, and Women are some of the areas
where we work using alternate ways of learning.

- Students Training

Our artistic techniques are designed on an interesting module of theatrics inculcated with performing arts approach that helps children to attain academic knowledge, along with social and emotional development. The all-round development enriches and motivates the learning experience fundamentally. The aim of The Roots India is to promote arts in education. For this, our methodology focuses on the growth and development of a child, letting him/her explore the values of different aspects of life, making him capable to opt for his personal choices, by discovering his own abilities and interests.

- Teacher Training:
According to our belief, things are rooted inside each and every being. And for the complete nourishment of these roots, teachers being the convener, play a crucial role while watering the tiny seeds. Therefore, understanding the importance of teachers as an important milestone of growth in a child’s learning experience;The Roots India presents a special teacher training program. The nourishment of our 
children’s guidance spirits is really very crucial for the future of our young minds. Our training for the teachers, inculcates artistic techniques for the creative upbringing of the bundle of joy under their guidance.


- Parent Training
Communication is an important bridge between parent-teacher relationships, for the growth of a young mind. The Roots India’s initiative also tries to come up with a platform of opportunities for the parents to communicate, discuss and come together at a forum with their personal viewpoint, suggestions and problems regarding their dealing with the young ones.

                        <p>AN INTRODUCTION FOR THE CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD OF THEATRE AND DRAMA IS CRUCIAL. THEREFORE, IN THEATRE WORKSHOPS OUR AIM IS TO WORK ON VARIOUS DRAMATIC ELEMENTS SUCH AS: • MOVEMENT • VOICE • POSTURE • CONCENTRATION • IMPROVISATION • CREATIVE WRITING • STORYTELLING • STAGE FEAR • ACTING SKILLS IMBIBING THE VALUES OF THEATRICS IN A CHILD COMBINING WITH AWARENESS ON SOCIAL ISSUES LEADS TO A CREATIVE RESPONSE. OUR WORKSHOPS ARE STRUCTURED ON A MODULE OF PROVIDING A SPACE OF EXPLORATION TO OUR CHILDREN, WHEREIN THEY ARE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE THEIR LEARNING THROUGH A PERFORMANCE, WHICH IN OUR WORDS IS “LEARNING IN PROGRESS OF A PERFORMANCE”. THIS CONSTANT LEARNING LEADS TO HEALTHY CHANGES IN THE PERSONAL LIFE OF A CHILD, ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN DIFFERENT AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS BENEFITTING HIM/HER.</p>

                        <p>THE BENEFITS OF THEATRE EDUCATION SELF-CONFIDENCE: TAKING RISKS IN CLASS AND PERFORMING FOR AN AUDIENCE TEACHES STUDENTS TO TRUST THEIR IDEAS AND ABILITIES. THIS CONFIDENCE WILL APPLY IN NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR FUTURE. IMAGINATION: IN A WORLD ADDICTED TO TECHNOLOGY, THEATRE PROVIDES AN OUTLET FOR MAKING CREATIVE CHOICES, THINKING NEW IDEAS, AND INTERPRETING THE MATERIAL IN EXPRESSIVE WAYS THAT ARE THE ESSENCE OF DRAMA. EMPATHY & TOLERANCE: ACTING ROLES FROM DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, TIME PERIODS, AND CULTURES PROMOTES COMPASSION AND TOLERANCE FOR OTHERS. COOPERATION/COLLABORATION: THEATRE COMBINES THE CREATIVE IDEAS AND ABILITIES FROM ITS PARTICIPANTS. CONCENTRATION: PLAYING, PRACTICING, AND PERFORMING DEVELOP A SUSTAINED FOCUS OF MIND, BODY, AND VOICE WHICH HELPS WITH OTHER AREAS OF LIFE INCLUDING SCHOOL. COMMUNICATION SKILLS: DRAMA ENHANCES VERBAL AND NONVERBAL EXPRESSION OF IDEAS. IT IMPROVES VOICE PROJECTION, ARTICULATION, FLUENCY OF LANGUAGE, AND PERSUASIVE SPEECH. PROBLEM SOLVING: STUDENTS LEARN TO COMMUNICATE THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, AND WHY TO THE AUDIENCE. IMPROVISATION FOSTERS QUICK-THINKING SOLUTIONS, WHICH LEADS TO GREATER ADAPTABILITY IN LIFE. FUN: THEATRE BRINGS PLAY, HUMOR, AND LAUGHTER TO LEARNING; THIS IMPROVES MOTIVATION AND REDUCES STRESS. TRUST: THE SOCIAL INTERACTION AND RISK TAKING IN DRAMA DEVELOP TRUST IN SELF, OTHERS, AND THE PROCESS. MEMORY: REHEARSING AND PERFORMING THE WORDS, MOVEMENTS, AND CUES STRENGTHEN THIS SKILL LIKE A MUSCLE. SOCIAL AWARENESS: LEGENDS, MYTHS, POEMS, STORIES, AND PLAYS USED IN DRAMA TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES AND CONFLICTS FROM CULTURES PAST, PRESENT, ALL OVER THE WORLD. AESTHETIC APPRECIATION: PARTICIPATING IN AND VIEWING THEATRE RAISE APPRECIATION FOR THE ART FORM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RAISE A GENERATION THAT UNDERSTANDS, VALUES, AND SUPPORTS THEATRE'S PLACE IN SOCIETY.</p>

BY EXPLORING ISSUES, IDEAS AND METHODS ACROSS THE HUMANITIES AND THE ARTS, AND THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE STUDENTS LEARN TO READ CRITICALLY, WRITE COGENTLY AND THINK BROADLY. THESE SKILLS ELEVATE THEIR CONVERSATIONS IN THE CLASSROOM AND STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS; IT CULTIVATES THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THEM TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD’S MOST COMPLEX ISSUES. OUR MODULES CHALLENGE THE STUDENTS TO CONSIDER NOT ONLY HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, BUT ALSO TRAIN THEM TO ASK WHICH PROBLEMS TO SOLVE AND WHY, PREPARING THEM FOR POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP AND A LIFE OF SERVICE TO THE NATION AND ALL OF HUMANITY.</p>
