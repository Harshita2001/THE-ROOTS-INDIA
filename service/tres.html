experiment and exploration. We, at The Roots India, believe that the children are the future of
the nation and they must learn beyond the four wall structure.
Our modules aim at experiential learning and using alternative education means to give the
children the opportunity to experiment with their ideas, explore their surroundings, experience
new situations and express their viewpoints. We work towards the overall development of a
child and instill an evolving thought process to make them liberal citizens of this developing
Nation.
Our modules are designed for a varied range of age groups and deal with the issues belonging to
that particular group only. Issues like Bullying, Sex Education, and Women are some of the areas
where we work using alternate ways of learning.

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Theatre Workshops</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">An introduction for the children into the world of theatre and drama is crucial. Therefore, in theatre workshops our aim is to work on various dramatic elements such as: • movement • voice • posture • concentration • improvisation • creative writing • storytelling • stage fear • acting skills imbibing the values of theatrics in a child combining with awareness on social issues leads to a creative response. Our workshops are structured on a module of providing a space of exploration to our children, wherein they are provided an opportunity to showcase their learning through a performance, which in our words is “learning in progress of a performance”. This constant learning leads to healthy changes in the personal life of a child, ultimately resulting in different and unexpected results benefitting him/her.</p>

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Theatre-In-Workshops</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">The benefits of theatre education self-confidence: taking risks in class and performing for an audience teaches students to trust their ideas and abilities. This confidence will apply in nearly every aspect of their future. Imagination: in a world addicted to technology, theatre provides an outlet for making creative choices, thinking new ideas, and interpreting the material in expressive ways that are the essence of drama. Empathy & tolerance: acting roles from different situations, time periods, and cultures promotes compassion and tolerance for others. Cooperation/collaboration: theatre combines the creative ideas and abilities from its participants. Concentration: playing, practicing, and performing develop a sustained focus of mind, body, and voice which helps with other areas of life including school. Communication skills: drama enhances verbal and nonverbal expression of ideas. It improves voice projection, articulation, fluency of language, and persuasive speech. Problem solving: students learn to communicate the who, what, where, when, and why to the audience. Improvisation fosters quick-thinking solutions, which leads to greater adaptability in life. Fun: theatre brings play, humor, and laughter to learning; this improves motivation and reduces stress. Trust: the social interaction and risk taking in drama develop trust in self, others, and the process. Memory: rehearsing and performing the words, movements, and cues strengthen this skill like a muscle. Social awareness: legends, myths, poems, stories, and plays used in drama teach students about social issues and conflicts from cultures past, present, all over the world. Aesthetic appreciation: participating in and viewing theatre raise appreciation for the art form. It is important to raise a generation that understands, values, and supports theatre's place in society.</p>

   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">We, at the roots india, believe that a liberal arts education offers an expansive intellectual grounding in all kinds of humanistic inquiry. By exploring issues, ideas and methods across the humanities and the arts, and the natural and social sciences, the students learn to read critically, write cogently and think broadly. These skills elevate their conversations in the classroom and strengthen their social and cultural analysis; it cultivates the tools necessary to allow them to navigate the world’s most complex issues. Our modules challenge the students to consider not only how to solve problems, but also train them to ask which problems to solve and why, preparing them for positions of leadership and a life of service to the nation and all of humanity.</p>

   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">Residential programs are known amongst people for their 100% success rate. These are one of the very few programs which bring together engagement and enhancement to the table at the same time and we are a strong believer of that. These programs hold different values for different environments (schools- corporate). From curation to creation, our team does it all. Finding the perfect venue to make a person leave his/ her comfort zone to be able to make them introspect to the deepest level is our intent of opting for a residential program. Our modules range from a day to a week depending on the teams’ requirement and their reason for opting it. A team of skilled trainers get together to prepare the perfect itinerary consisting of various activities to yield positive results.</p>
