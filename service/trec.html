                 <p data-animate="fadeInUp" class="lead">We, at The Roots India, believe that there comes a point in every individual’s life
wherein he/she feels difficult to manage his/her personal goals with the goals of the
organization. Since corporate are dealing with humans, it is very important for them
to explore and enhance the Emotional Quotient of their employees other than the
Intelligence Quotient.
We are the only organization using performing arts as a medium for enhancement in
a corporate set up. We work towards decreasing the attenuation rate by creating a
sense of belongingness for the employees. We work towards creating an
environment which not only elevates them as an employee but also at the individual
level.
Our modules based on performing arts work on communication skills, conflict
management, team building, self confidence amongst many other with all segments
of an organization, be it HR, Marketing, Finance, or Operations. Our modules are
designed for every level of management from top to manager level and also cater to
different age groups.
With this the employees start experimenting with their ideas, exploring new
dimensions, experiencing and expressing their view points which in turn empowers
them as well as the organization.
If you are looking for such a module for your organization, connect with us at <a href="mailto:"therootssociety@gmail.com"">therootssociety@gmail.com.</a></p><br><br>

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR GOAL FROM SOMEONE ELSE’S POINT OF VIEW, WE CAN EASILY ANALYZE WHERE WE ARE LACKING. EMPATHY HELPS IN BRINGING THE BEST OUT OF THE EMPLOYEE BY KNOWING THEM AT A PERSONAL LEVEL.</p>
