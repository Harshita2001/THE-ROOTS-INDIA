                 <p data-animate="fadeInUp" class="lead">We, at The Roots India, believe that there comes a point in every individual’s life
wherein he/she feels difficult to manage his/her personal goals with the goals of the
organization. Since corporate are dealing with humans, it is very important for them
to explore and enhance the Emotional Quotient of their employees other than the
Intelligence Quotient.
We are the only organization using performing arts as a medium for enhancement in
a corporate set up. We work towards decreasing the attenuation rate by creating a
sense of belongingness for the employees. We work towards creating an
environment which not only elevates them as an employee but also at the individual
level.
Our modules based on performing arts work on communication skills, conflict
management, team building, self confidence amongst many other with all segments
of an organization, be it HR, Marketing, Finance, or Operations. Our modules are
designed for every level of management from top to manager level and also cater to
different age groups.
With this the employees start experimenting with their ideas, exploring new
dimensions, experiencing and expressing their view points which in turn empowers
them as well as the organization.
If you are looking for such a module for your organization, connect with us at <a href="mailto:"therootssociety@gmail.com"">therootssociety@gmail.com.</a></p><br><br>

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Communication Building</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">Communication is the key feature of all the organizations. A healthy communication creates a positive environment. We focus on creating communication that helps in building trust among the employees. When a group of people working together trust each other, they respect each other’s space and try to be there for each other, which ultimately results in improved performance of the organization as whole.</p>

   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">As rightly said, “co-ordination is the essence of management.” co-ordination is the breath of all organization without which no organization can last long. Some of our activities focus completely on building coordination among the employees. The program is designed in a way to bring the employer and the employees on the same page.</p>

<div id="myDIV2" style="display: none;"> <section>
   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Knowing Yourself</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">An employee, who knows him/herself, knows his/her positives and negatives. Performing arts helps a person in knowing him/herself in the best possible way. Through the activities developed over a period of almost 10 years by the members of the roots india, we help people in exploring themselves. The activities work wonders and people get to know some of their sides which they did not know existed. This leads to a team of confident employees who know how they can be of the greatest help for the organization.</p>

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Conflict Management</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">Conflict is one of the biggest enemies of the success of an organization. A healthy environment of a workplace demands no conflicts. It is very important for the people working together to feel as a team and understand each other’s problems. This has always motivated us to create an environment that helps in maintaining positivity around the employees. By knowing each other at a personal level, the employees develop a bond of trust and such an environment is created where people care about one another, thus resolving half of the problems of the employer.</p>

 </section></div>
 <script>
function myFunction3() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV3");

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Empathizing</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">People enjoy working at a place that gives the feel of belongingness. A happy employee works more efficiently than an unhappy one. We focus on building an empathetic environment where people feel they are being listened to and that their point of view matters. This is very important as when we look at our goal from someone else’s point of view, we can easily analyze where we are lacking. Empathy helps in bringing the best out of the employee by knowing them at a personal level.</p>

 </section></div>
 <script>
function myFunction4() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV4");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";

This has given us the motive of exploring the creativity of the individuals working together. A proper guidance is important for shaping a mind to know itself in a better way. We aim at providing the much needed support to every employee so that their creative skills could flourish.</p>

 </section></div>
 <script>
function myFunction6() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV6");

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Performance ( Engagement )</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">We create performances with the employees which help them in knowing their goals in a creative way.

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Offsite visits(Engagement)</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">We feel working daily in the same place becomes tiring. So, to freshen the minds of the employee, we ideate offsite projects which are important to know the working outside the walls of the organization which results in better plans for the organization.</p>

 </section></div>
 <script>
function myFunction8() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV8");

   <h2 style="color:#D3D3D3;" ><center>Outbound Projects(Engagement)</center></h2>
   <p class="lead" style=" margin-right: 12%;margin-left: 12%;">It is very important for the employees to know how the market is behaving towards their certain project. So, instead of evaluating it from the distance, it is important for them to actually be in the situation and analyze things. This has motivated us in creating new outbound projects for the organization.</p>

 </section></div>
 <script>
function myFunction9() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIV9");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
